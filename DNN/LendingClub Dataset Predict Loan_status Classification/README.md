# Predict Loan_status Classification

The Data

We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.

Goal

Given data on loan with information of borrower who paid loan fully or charge-off. We are building a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

"loan_status" instance contains the label.
